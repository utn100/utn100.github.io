      <h2 id="title">An anlysis on the #metoo movement and social perception on sexual harassment</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>On October 15, actress Alyssa Milano posted a tweet with hashtag Me too, following the accusation of Harvey Weinstein on multiple sexual assault accounts by Hollywood actresses.
        Following that, the social media has been flooded with millions of #Metoo and stories by victims of sexual abuse all over the world <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/10/16/me-too-alyssa-milano-urged-assault-victims-to-tweet-in-solidarity-the-response-was-massive/?utm_term=.5b42504801d">(washingtonpost)</a>.
        The Harvey Weinstein incident also raised questions on why his victims did not report him any time sooner, even when they already gained career success.
        Does social perception on sexual assault changes through time and does it influence how victims respond when things happen to them? Does technology play
        a role in raising awareness of this pressing issue?
        </p>
        <p>To answer these questions, I propose to use text analytic tools to explore the topics on how social perception on sexual harassment evolved through time using social media data
        including Twitter, Facebook, and news articles.</p>
      <h3>Broader Significances</h3>
        <p>Sexual assault is a serious issue that has been existing in all societies for a long time. In the US alone, every 1 in 6 women and every 1 in 33 men experienced attempted or
        completed rape in their lifetime <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">(rainn.org)</a>. Insights gained from this project can be applied to raise social
         awareness and help build educational models and effective preventive tools.</p>

      <h4>Scrape twitter</h4>
      <p>Tweet scraping using <a href="https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper">twitterscraper</a>, advantages of this over using twitter API
      is that it allows to go back pass 7 days. However this method does not provide detailed information of user such as user location like the API method.
